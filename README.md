# jupyterlab-cell-formatter-black

This is modified from [https://github.com/tobinjones/jupyterlab_formatblack](https://github.com/tobinjones/jupyterlab_formatblack)

Formats cells using the `Black` uncompromising Python code formatter.
This is quite a hacky solution that relies on the `blackcellmagic` extension by csurfer.
It adds the command `Format cell with Black` which just
 1. adds the text `%%black` to the top of the cell, and
 2. runs the cell

You can add a keyboard shortcut by adding something like...

```json
{
  "black:format-cell": {
    "command": "black:format-cell",
    "keys": ["F"],
    "selector": ".jp-Notebook:focus"
  }
}
```

... to the keyboard shortcuts in jupyterlab settings.
